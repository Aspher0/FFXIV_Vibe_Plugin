# Unofficial trigger packs

Here are a list of packs that were made by the community. You will need to import the trigger from the "Importation" directory.
Then you will need to define the device that will be used for each triggers.

## Val pack

**Description**:
Trigger sets created by Vel. There are currently triggers for the following classes:
- Dancer
- Dark Knight
- Dragoon
- Red Mage
- General

The "General" class contains triggers that can be used across other classes, as they are triggers that responds to things Greetings, Teleporting, and Duty Pops. Feel free to mix and match to your liking whenever you import them. I'd highly recommend making profiles for each class (if you're part of the Premium Subscription).

**Installation Process:**
- 1) Decide which triggers you'd like to import.
- 2) Place them into your importation directory, and click "Import Triggers"
- 3) For each triggers imported, you'll need to set the devices manually.
