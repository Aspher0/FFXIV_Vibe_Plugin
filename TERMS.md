# Terms of Service 

**Last Updated:** 2023.09.05

## Introduction

Welcome to FFXIV_Vibe_Plugin. These Terms of Service ("Terms", "ToS") govern
your use of our application and services ("Application", "Services"), and any
license or secret token ("Token") provided by us, available at FFXIV_Vibe_Plugin
and through various other platforms.

By using our Application, you agree to these Terms of Service. If you do not
agree to these Terms, you should not use the Application or Services.

## Single User and Single Client Application Policy for Tokens

### Single User Policy

Each Token provided through our Services, regardless of the tier or package
("Tier") it is associated with, is intended to be used by a single user only.
Sharing your Token with others is strictly prohibited. Violating this policy may
result in the immediate termination of your Token and access to our Services
without refund.

### Single Client Application Policy

Your Token is to be used on a single client application only. You are not
permitted to use the Token on multiple client applications. Doing so is a
violation of these Terms and may result in immediate revocation of your Token
and access to our Services without refund.

## Violations

If we discover that you have violated the Single User or Single Client
Application policies described above, we reserve the right to terminate your
Token and access to our Services immediately, without notice, and without
refund.

## Modifications to Terms

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify these Terms at any time.
It is your responsibility to review these Terms regularly. Your continued use of
the Application following any changes to these Terms constitutes your acceptance
of the new Terms.

If you have any questions about these Terms, please contact us on Discord.
